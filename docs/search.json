Along with 2 mechanical engineering students, I desigined an expeirmental rig demonstrating the principle of vibration isolation during base excitation. Vibration suppression for a mechanical system can be achieved at the source or the receiver; however, vibration isolation, which uses a combination of springs and dampers to isolate the mass from input vibration, is the preferred technique. The significance of vibration isolation lies in its ability to improve the performance, reliability, and safety of structural and mechanical systems, as well as to reduce the transmission of noise and vibrations. The rig consisted of an arduino controlled stepper motor to incite excitation at the base which transmitted to a primary mass - lumped steel plates- on the other side of the spring."

The goal of the competition is to push the opponent’s robot outside a 3ftby-3ft ring made of neoprene rubber. Comprising of 3 mechanical engineering students, our team was tasked with designing and fabricating a 10 inch by 10 inch by 6-inch robot with a weight limit of no more than 5 lbs. To plan the design process, the team broke down the timeline into sub parts – brainstorming, preliminary sketches, final designs, finding mechanical parts, making computer-aided designs, fabricating, finding electrical components, and finalizing the assembly. The team named the robot JASPER which was successful in detecting the edges of the mat and re-directing its trajectory."

In this project, a GNC model is implemented for a missile to successfully intercept a target projectile. To simplify the model, only longitudinal dynamics of the missile are analyzed. Accordingly, the height of the missile and distance along the ground are the only elements of interest. This is referred to as ”short period approximation”, through which the longitudinal dynamics are determined at the equilibrium where thrust effects are considered to be zero and coupling between lateral and longitudinal dynamics is neglected. For state estimation, an observer is designed and simple trigonometry is used as the mathematical framework for the guidance model. The entire control architecture along with the system dynamics is implemented in Simulink."

    "text": "A Brief Synopsis\nRISFK - Refugee in Flight Shelter Kit was one of the 6 projects offered in EID-101 class, Engineering Design and Problem Solving. As conflict and adverse environmental changes uproot communities in Sub-Saharan Africa, RiFSK addressed the lack of shelter that these individuals face in transit. In our team’s venture to design a portable, effective, and biodegradable shelter, we adhered to the principles of simplicity, efficiency, and self-sufficiency to develop the model.\nThe team was divided into seven smaller groups to better specialize on the numerous facets of RiFSK: four dedicated to the development and analysis of the design, two to its logistics, and one to the coordination of the different elements of the design process.\nI was a part of the frame team, along with 3 more students, which was tasked with designing a frame design that could be built in less than a minute from local resources - bamboo and yarn. Following other design iterations, our final design characterized by its dome structure, is arguably the simplest RiFSK design to date. I got this design from a bow and how it is bent in its curved shape using a string. Accordingly, I brought up the idea of having the bamboo go through the slits of the fabric and bend it using barn strings. Consequently, ease of assembly, disassembly, and disposal all promote RiFSK 2020 as a product that requires little effort or knowledge to use. An academic paper on the design methodology can be found below."

This was followed by setting up the mass matrix, frame rotation matrix, and external forces/torques matrix. After deriving the entire dynamics, different test cases are executed to ensure the validity of the model and the spring/damping constants are tuned to achieve a system which resonates with fish’s oscillatory motion."
