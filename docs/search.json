    "text": "Overview\nAs a final project for ME-494 (Bio - Inspired Robotics), I along with a team of other 2 students designed and fabricated a self-burrowing robot called CASPER - Cooper Automated Subterranian Probing And Excavating Robot. The end goal of the project was to design and test two different leg geometries - Klann (designed and fabricated by myself) and double linkage - by performing kinematic simulations and getting actual data from tracker. While the Klann geometry was derived from the movement of a spider, the double linkage geometry was derived from the motion of a mole crab. Using dry rice as the medium to dig and stepper motor to actuate the robot, the team was able to collect data from both geometries and resulting conclusions were derived. The academic paper on the design and results, along with a working model of the Klann geometry, can be found below.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Overview\nAs the end project of ME-360, Experimentation, each team was tasked to design and fabricate an apparatus exhibiting a scientific principle. Along with 2 mechanical engineering students, I desigined an expeirmental rig demonstrating the principle of vibration isolation during base excitation.\nVibration suppression for a mechanical system can be achieved at the source or the receiver; however, vibration isolation, which uses a combination of springs and dampers to isolate the mass from input vibration, is the preferred technique. The significance of vibration isolation lies in its ability to improve the performance, reliability, and safety of structural and mechanical systems, as well as to reduce the transmission of noise and vibrations.\nThe rig consisted of an arduino controlled stepper motor to incite excitation at the base which transmitted to a primary mass - lumped steel plates- on the other side of the spring. A working video of the apparatus and an academic papaer its design can be found below.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

The goal of the competition is to push the opponent’s robot outside a 3ftby-3ft ring made of neoprene rubber. Comprising of 3 mechanical engineering students, our team was tasked with designing and fabricating a 10 inch by 10 inch by 6-inch robot with a weight limit of no more than 5 lbs.\nTo plan the design process, the team broke down the timeline into sub parts – brainstorming, preliminary sketches, final designs, finding mechanical parts, making computer-aided designs, fabricating, finding electrical components, and finalizing the assembly. The team named the robot JASPER which was successful in detecting the edges of the mat and re-directing its trajectory.\nA video showing JASPER in action and an academic paper on its complete design and fabrication can be found below."

    "text": "Overview\nRISFK - Refugee in Flight Shelter Kit was one of the 6 projects offered in EID-101 class, Engineering Design and Problem Solving. As conflict and adverse environmental changes uproot communities in Sub-Saharan Africa, RiFSK addressed the lack of shelter that these individuals face in transit. In our team’s venture to design a portable, effective, and biodegradable shelter, we adhered to the principles of simplicity, efficiency, and self-sufficiency to develop the model.\nThe team was divided into seven smaller groups to better specialize on the numerous facets of RiFSK: four dedicated to the development and analysis of the design, two to its logistics, and one to the coordination of the different elements of the design process.\nI was a part of the frame team, along with 3 more students, which was tasked with designing a frame design that could be built in less than a minute from local resources - bamboo and yarn. Following other design iterations, our final design characterized by its dome structure, is arguably the simplest RiFSK design to date. I got this design from a bow and how it is bent in its curved shape using a string. Accordingly, I brought up the idea of having the bamboo go through the slits of the fabric and bend it using barn strings. Consequently, ease of assembly, disassembly, and disposal all promote RiFSK 2020 as a product that requires little effort or knowledge to use. An academic paper on the design methodology can be found below."

By using the method of virtual work and projections, I computed the rotation matrices for each of the 3 pivots, angular velocities, and corresponding jacobians. This was followed by setting up the mass matrix, frame rotation matrix, and external forces/torques matrix. Different test cases were executed to ensure the validity of the model and improve its accuracy.

The project was built on a pre-existing python framework designed by Randy Beard: “Small Unmanned Aircraft: Theory and Practice” which can be found online. The framework included a pre-built graphical interface using pyQt and pyQtgraph modules which allowed to visualize the UAV.
