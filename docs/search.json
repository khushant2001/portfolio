The data sets used are subjected to basic linear algebra techniques such as Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for model reduction. This is followed by system id using methods such as Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), Eigenanalysis Realization Algorithm (ERA), and Sparse Identification of Non Linear Dynamics (Sindy) to generate linear models for non-linear systems. Since the main goal is to design controllers for these systems, linear systems allow to construct controllers such as Linear Quadratic Controller (LQR) and Model Predictive Control (MPC). The datasets used consists of Flow over Airfoils, Flight Dynamics Datasets, and basic systems such as mass spring and inverted pendulum."

    "text": "1. Using Singular Value Decomposition to recreate the fluid flow over an airfoil!\nIn order to understand the significance of Singular Value Decomposition, especially in the field of compression, a big dataset of flow velocities found here is subjected to the algorithm. Specifically, the dataset for airfoil with angle of attack of 25 degrees and frequency of 0.05 hz is used. The dataset itself (for both X and Y velocity) comes in a 3-D matrix, where the first two dimensions represent the velocity for individual snapshots in time. Accordingly, the third dimension contains the number of snapshots, which are 400 in total. Before performing SVD on the dataset, pre-processing is done in the following format:\n\nThe 2-D grid of velocities is shaped into a single column vector.\nIndividual snapshots are then horizontally stacked as column vectors. Accordingly, the final product is a big 2-D matrix where columns are snapshots of velocities at consecutive times.\nThe 2-D grid of X and Y velocity is stacked vertically to make the analysis less repetetive.\nThe mean of every column is subtracted, serving the purpose of normalizing the data.\n\nFinally, the data is ready to be subjected to an economy SVD and the following matrices are derived: U, S, V. The matrix U contains information about the spatial modes while the product of S and V’ contains information about the temporal ampltiude of the corresponding modes in U. As expected, SVD figures out which pattern in the data summarizes it the best. A graphic of the eigenvalues (square of the singular values of the data) is show below.\n\nThe first 6 spatial modes which are basically the first 6 column vectors of U are shown below as well. Since the big data matrix contains both x and y velocities, it is important to remember that the top half of the matrix contains the x velocity and bottom half contains the y velocity.\n\n\nThe corresponding temporal amplitude for these modes is also shown below. As seen, the first 2 dominant modes follow a cyclic wave which are at an offset of a quarter wave.\n\nFinally, the construction of the flows is performed by choosing a certain number of columns (&lt;400). The mean subtracted from individual columns is added back to the columns selected for reconstruction and the columns are also shaped back to the grid format. By choosing which snapshot to view, a contour plot can be generated, as shown below for first snapshot or t = 1 sec. \n\nFollowing is the video of the reconstruction of the flows can be found in the files attached in the repository.

    "text": "2. Using Dynamic Mode Decomposition to recreate the fluid flow over an airfoil!\nDynamic mode decomposition tries to find the best fit “linear operator” which can predict the next state of the system. Consider ‘X’ to be the state of the system at time t=k and “X’” to be the state at k+1, then DMD finds the A that can satsify the equations listed below. By taking the inverse of X’, A can be determined.\n\\[\nX' = A * X\n\\]\n\\[\nA = X' * X^{-1}\n\\]\nSince the matrix X is not always square, Singular Value Decomposition from above is used to find the pseudo-inverse. Equations below show expansion of the matrix X based on SVD and its inverse in terms of the individual matrix. Another important characteristic about DMD is that it finds a matrix called A tilda which is much smaller in size as compared to the original A but has the same eigenvalues. This decreases the computation cost by a lot.\n\\[\nX = U * \\Sigma * V*\n\\]\n\\[\nX' = A * U * \\Sigma * V*\n\\]\n\\[\nA\\sim = U * X' * V * \\Sigma^{-1} = U* * A * U\n\\]\nOnce A tilda is know, its eigenvalues (W) can be calculated which are same as A and then the eigenvectors of A which are labelled as phi can be determined through back calculation using lambda.\n\\[\nA\\sim * \\lambda = \\lambda * W\n\\]\n\\[\n\\phi = X' * V * \\Sigma^{-1} * \\lambda\n\\]\nTo perform a DMD on the same flow field, the velocities are stacked in a similar format as before to make the X matrix and the first column is deleted to make X’. The airfoil data used for this has an angle of attack of 25 degrees with freq of 0.05 Hz. Subjecting to DMD analysis, the amplitudes of the modes are derived and the plot is listed below: \nAlso, the contour plot for the first 4 modes along with their frequency is given below: \nFinally, the reconstruction of the fluid flow is performed using the DMD Algorithm and the following the comparison: Following is the video of the fluid reconstruction using DMD and first 20 POD modes.

Eigensystem Realization Algorithm (ERA)\nERA is a data based analysis of a system which is capable of determining the discrete state space matrices: A, B, & C using the impulse response.

A, B, and C matrices are generated using the following:\n\\[\nSVD(H) = U \\sigma V^{*}\n\\]\n\\[\nA = \\sigma^{-.5} U^{T} H' V \\sigma^{.5}\n\\]\n\\[\nB = \\sigma^{.5} U^{T} H\n\\]\n\\[\nC = H V \\sigma^{.5}\n\\]\nTo understand this approximation, ERA is tried on the transfer function decribing the Atomic Force Microscope.

The results are shown below. \nTo see the effects of the addition of the white to the system, random normal gaussian noise is added to the impulse response and subjected to the ERA estimation. Surprisingly, the noise does not decrease the accuracy of the estimation; only does at high frequency. This makes sense because by taking SVD of the hankel matrix, the low energy pod modes are neglected which contain the noise. The results of the addition of white noise to the system are shown below:"

Along with 2 mechanical engineering students, I desigined an expeirmental rig demonstrating the principle of vibration isolation during base excitation. Vibration suppression for a mechanical system can be achieved at the source or the receiver; however, vibration isolation, which uses a combination of springs and dampers to isolate the mass from input vibration, is the preferred technique. The significance of vibration isolation lies in its ability to improve the performance, reliability, and safety of structural and mechanical systems, as well as to reduce the transmission of noise and vibrations. The rig consisted of an arduino controlled stepper motor to incite excitation at the base which transmitted to a primary mass - lumped steel plates- on the other side of the spring."

    "text": "1. Designing the controller for wall following:\n\nI. Bang - Bang controller\nFor the first try, a simple bang bang controller is designed which takes in the Ir sensor readings and descides the angular velocity based on hardcoded limits on the intensities. The implementation is done in the “test” node which can be run by doing “ros2 run controller new”. Following is the algorithm put to use:\n\nGet the IR sensor readings.\nMode 1: If the max intensity of 3 IR sensors from left is higher than 100, move closer to the wall with anglular velocity of 0.2.\nMode 2: If the max intensity of leftmost sensor is less than 10, move closer to the wall with angular velocity of 0.4.\nMode 3: If any IR reading is greater than 350, find the respective sensor. If the sensor if in the left [0:3] then move to the right with angular velocity of -0.6.\n\nDespite working properly, the controller isnt’t precise at all and is extremely slow. Increasing the linear speed would mess up the logic. Accordingly, its not adequate.\n\n\nII. PID controller\nFor the second try, a PID controller is implemented to keep the intensity of the leftmost IR sensor at 70 (setpoint). Accordingly, the error is determined and is processed as follows:\n\\[\nu = K_p * error + K_i * \\int error \\,dt + K_d * \\frac{d(error)}{dt}\n\\]\nThe gains are tuned manually using the Ziegler–Nichols method. While setting K_i, and K_d to 0, the proportional gain K_p is increased untill oscillation is observed. Following this, the K_I is increased to decrease the oscillation. Since the IR sensor is noisy, very small K_d is used to provide braking action on the controller. It is observed that without K_d, the Irobot has a little difficulty in manuvering tight corners. It is to be noted that the gains change according to the linear speed. Higher linear speed requires more agressive gains. To achieve the best performance, linear speed of 1.0 is set and the gains are tuned accordingly. The final gains are given below:\n\\[\nK_i = 0.05\n\\]\n\\[\nK_p = 0.027\n\\]\n\\[\nK_d = 0.001\n\\]\nSince the PID only sets the intensity of the left most IR sensor, the robot acts up at right angles: walls infront and ahead of the Irobot. Although this might be avoided by having filleted walls but it is unrealistic. Accordingly, an additional mode is added to the controller. If the front IR sensor value is higher than 10 then the pid controller is stopeed and a constant angular velocity of -0.4 is set for the rotation which turns the Irobot to the right. The magnitude 0.4 is chosen by trial and error. Using the combination of these 2 logics, the Irobot can easily follow the walls as shown in the video above."

Since the location give through IMU is with respect to the base station, the starting position of the Irobot is saved and any following position is recorded as the difference of current position and starting position. Accordingly, the origin is changed.\nTo remember the location, a 2D numpy matrix “obstacles” is created. The current location received from IMU is rounded to the floor and multiplied by 5 to increase precision. Then the respective X and Y coordinate is used as index to traverse the obstacles matrix.\nIf the X index is bigger than the number of rows of obstacle matrix, a row of shape ( current X, number of columns in obstacle) is vertically stacked.\nIf the Y index is bigger than number of columns of obstacle matrix, a column of shape (number of rows in obstacle, 1) is horizontally stacked.\nOtherwise, the cell referring to current X and Y index is marked by 1.\n\nAccordingly, in the end, a fully populated matrix of 1 and 0 is displayed showing the path of the vehicle."

    "text": "A Brief Synopsis\nGuidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) System allows a complicated system to estimate its state, determine its next trajectory, and steps to achieve that determined trajectory. In this project, a GNC model is implemented for a missile to successfully intercept a target projectile. To simplify the model, only longitudinal dynamics of the missile are analyzed. Accordingly, the height of the missile and distance along the ground are the only elements of interest. This is referred to as ”short period approximation”, through which the longitudinal dynamics are determined at the equilibrium where thrust effects are considered to be zero and only the torque generated from elevators is considered. For state estimation, an observer is designed and simple trigonometry is used as the mathematical framework for the guidance model. The entire control architecture along with the system dynamics is implemented in Simulink."

    "section": "A Brief Synopsis",
    "text": "A Brief Synopsis\nRISFK - Refugee in Flight Shelter Kit was one of the 6 projects offered in EID-101 class, Engineering Design and Problem Solving. As conflict and adverse environmental changes uproot communities in Sub-Saharan Africa, RiFSK addressed the lack of shelter that these individuals face in transit. In our team’s venture to design a portable, effective, and biodegradable shelter, we adhered to the principles of simplicity, efficiency, and self-sufficiency to develop the model.\nThe team was divided into seven smaller groups to better specialize on the numerous facets of RiFSK: four dedicated to the development and analysis of the design, two to its logistics, and one to the coordination of the different elements of the design process.\nI was a part of the frame team, along with 3 more students, which was tasked with designing a frame design that could be built in less than a minute from local resources - bamboo and yarn. Following other design iterations, our final design characterized by its dome structure, is arguably the simplest RiFSK design to date. I got this design from a bow and how it is bent in its curved shape using a string. Accordingly, I brought up the idea of having the bamboo go through the slits of the fabric and bend it using barn strings. Consequently, ease of assembly, disassembly, and disposal all promote RiFSK 2020 as a product that requires little effort or knowledge to use. An academic paper on the design methodology can be found below."

The nodes use pub-sub method for communication and do so through custom topics and messages. The rqt_graph of the overall architecture is shown in the figure above."

By using the method of virtual work and projections, I computed the rotation matrices for each of the 3 pivots, angular velocities, and corresponding Jacobians. This was followed by setting up the mass matrix, frame rotation matrix, and external forces/torques matrix. After deriving the entire dynamics, different test cases are executed to ensure the validity of the model and the spring/damping constants are tuned to achieve a system which resonates with fish’s oscillatory motion."

As a semester long project, I was tasked with creating a digital twin which model the UAV’s rigid-body dynamics, aerodynamics, feedback control, and state estimation using sensors. Accordingly, I implemented the rigid body dynamics using Euler laws of motion for 12 DOF; aerodynamics with linear approximations of the lift (C_L) and drag (C_D) coefficients given by Beard; feedback control using standard PID, and state estimation using Kalman Filters. The project is built on a pre-existing python framework designed by Randy Beard: “Small Unmanned Aircraft: Theory and Practice” which can be found online. While the framework included a pre-built graphical interface using pyQt and pyQtgraph modules to visualize the UAV, all the flight control implementation is done from scratch."
